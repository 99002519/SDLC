V Model
Agile Model
S/w testing
CI/CD

Assessment -- MCQ based, Learning Report with Peer Reviewed 

Based on topics, activities are assigned daily 


Alpha 
Beta
Release Candidate (RC)

Testing should be stopped as soon as requirements are met. 
Defect - Deviation from the requirements

If issue found by a tester, he has the authority of managing the testing priorities because he knows the impact.

Clear requirements & Tech known -- V Model used
Req are littile unknown & Tech also newer -- Agile Model used

Define  ---  Beverage Dispenser
Research   ---   Aging and Costing
Defining our project   ---   Own Features, enhancements

Requirements   ---   HLR -- feature level , LLR -- how feature becomes functional like quality, qty, electricity, heating filament, grinding

System Design 
Draw UML diagrams 
-- Structural , Behavioral ( Min 2 req at each level HLR, LLR )

Test Plans 
-- Integration level TP, Low level TP
	Table of 5 columns Test ID, Descr, Expected i/p, Expected o/p, Actual o/p 
	Trace every req from HLR to LLR to Test Plans ----  Traceability
	
Component Diagram - sw hw, Use case diagram, Flow chart -- user, maintenance, etc etc
@ integration level test plan (comes in HLR) -- Amount of coffee and milk simultaneously, 
@unit test plan -- what beverage we want, it should come 

Req based testing, Scenario based, Boundary condition based.
